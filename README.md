# To-Do List App

This To-Do List app is a simple application created by Tshiamo Tsoku.

# Technologies Used

- React: This app is built using React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React allows for the creation of reusable UI components, making it easy to build interactive web applications.

- JavaScript: JavaScript is the programming language used to add interactivity to the app. It handles user input, updates the UI, and manages the application's state.

- Local Storage: The app utilizes the browser's local storage to save the to-do list items. This allows the user's to-do list to persist even after refreshing the page or closing the browser.

# Approach

The approach taken to build this app was to create a simple and intuitive user interface for managing to-do list items. The app allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks from their personal and family to-do lists. Each task can be marked as completed, and the app utilizes local storage to save the tasks, ensuring that the data persists across sessions.
